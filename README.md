## Introduction
This is the core marketplace price analysis engine for Steam Analyst! It reguarly gets the latest prices for CS:GO items. I objected about how Steam Analyst is profiting huge margins from data which can be obtained for free. So, an insider leaked the core components for other people to build their own ```Analyst``` or use the item price data without being charged unreasonable amounts by Steam Analyst.
